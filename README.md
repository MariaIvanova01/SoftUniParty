# SoftUniParty

There is a party in SoftUni. Many guests are invited, and they are two types: VIP and regular. 
When a guest comes, you have to check if he/she exists on any of the two reservation lists. All reservation numbers will be with 8 chars. All VIP numbers start with a digit.
There will be 2 command lines:

-	First is "PARTY" - the party is on and guests start coming.

-	The second is "END" - then the party is over, and no more guests will come.

The output shows all guests, who didn't come to the party (VIP must be first).
